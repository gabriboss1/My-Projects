# Log-In Page

3/3/2024


I wanted to practice CSS, specifically making dynamic elements, so I followed a tutorial and made this Log-In and Sign-In page front-end.
It is not functional, but it can have a very nice application if I decide to make a website that involves logging in/signing up, in the future.
