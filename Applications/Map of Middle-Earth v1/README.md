# Interactice Map of Middle-Earth (Version 1)

12/28/2024


Because the Lord of the Rings is my favorite book, I wanted to create an interactive experience that allows others to explore its landscapes in a unique way.
My goal was to bring Tolkien's world to life in a way that engages and educates, and that is available to everyone.

Now, I aim to enhance the map by adding a search tool, allowing users to find specific locations across Middle-earth easily. I would like to make this the most advanced and immersive interactive map there is, providing an unparalleled exploration experience for fans and enthusiasts.
