# Messaging App

12/9/2024

Making a messaging app has always intrigued me, so I decided to build a chat room for my friends and me to chat together. It is called ASM Chat Room because anybody from ASM can join and talk with their peers.
It is a great way to meet new people from the school. One thing I could implement in the future is a system that bans people who spam messages or write derogatory remarks. 
Through this, I have strengthened my skills in building an interface and learned more about sockets and their use.

IMPORTANT: The server app could have issues while running, as some machines have firewalls enabled that block the socket transmissions.
