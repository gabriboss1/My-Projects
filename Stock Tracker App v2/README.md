# Stock Tracker App


10/10/2024


I wasn't satisfied with the original Stock Tracker, so I improved it in this second version. Now, the graphs are nicer as a time frame can be set, and the color scheme looks more like a Bloomberg Terminal interface. 

I still want to improve more aspects, such as updating the prices in real-time.
