# Messaging App

12/9/2024

Making a messaging app has always intrigued me, so I decided to build a chat room for my friends and me, on which we could chat together. It is called ASM Chat Room because anybody from ASM could join and talk with other people.
It is a great way to meet new people from the school. One thing I could implement in the future is a banning system for people who spam messages or write derogatory remarks. 
Through this I have strengthened my skills in building an interface and learned more about sockets and their use.
